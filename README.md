### **Task 4: Integration of Python in Power BI for Advanced Data Analysis and Visualization**  

In **Task 4** of our Power BI internship at **CodTech**, we successfully integrated **Python scripts** within Power BI to perform **advanced data analysis and visualization**. This task required us to use Python to process and visualize sales data, making the report more interactive and insightful. We leveraged **Python's data manipulation and visualization libraries** such as **pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn** to generate meaningful insights.

## **üìå Objective of Task 4**  
The main objective was to **enhance Power BI's visualization capabilities** using **Python scripting**. By integrating Python, we were able to create custom charts that are not natively available in Power BI, providing deeper insights into **sales performance by product and region**. The final deliverable was a **Power BI report showcasing Python‚Äôs capabilities** in data analysis and visualization.

## **üìå Step-by-Step Execution**  

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Loading Data into Power BI**  
We started by importing our dataset into Power BI. The dataset included **Product, Region, and Sales Amount** fields, which were essential for analysis. After ensuring that the data was structured correctly, we proceeded to integrate Python within Power BI.  

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Enabling Python Scripting in Power BI**  
Before using Python in Power BI, we enabled **Python scripting** by configuring the **Python home directory** under **File ‚Üí Options and settings ‚Üí Options ‚Üí Python scripting**. This ensured Power BI could execute Python scripts without issues.  

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Adding a Python Visual**  
To begin the analysis, we inserted a **Python Visual** from the **Visualizations pane**. We then dragged **Product, Region, and Sales Amount** into the **Values section**, allowing Power BI to pass these fields into Python for processing.  

### **4Ô∏è‚É£ Writing and Executing the Python Script**  
Inside the **Python Script Editor**, we wrote a Python script to **analyze and visualize** the dataset. The script included:  
‚úî **Data Aggregation:** Grouping sales data by **Product** and **Region** to calculate total sales.  
‚úî **Bar Chart for Sales by Product:** Showing the **total sales for each product** to identify best-selling and least-selling products.  
‚úî **Pie Chart for Sales Distribution by Region:** Displaying **sales percentages across different regions** to understand market performance.  

The script used `pandas` for data processing and `matplotlib/seaborn` for visualization. We then **executed the script**, and Power BI successfully displayed the generated visuals.

## **üìå Finalizing the Report**  

### **5Ô∏è‚É£ Adjusting and Formatting the Visuals**  
After running the Python script, we made adjustments to improve readability:  
‚úî **Resized the Python Visual** to fit the report layout properly.  
‚úî **Modified colors, labels, and grid styles** for better clarity.  
‚úî **Added report titles and descriptions** using Power BI text elements.  

### **6Ô∏è‚É£ Saving and Publishing the Report**  
Once the visualizations were optimized, we **saved** the report as `Sales_Analysis_Report.pbix`. We also explored the option of **publishing the report to Power BI Service** for sharing.
